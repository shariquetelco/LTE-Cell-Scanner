**LTE Cell Scanner / Tracker**
--------------------------

This is a collection of tools to locate and track LTE basestation cells using
very low performance RF front ends. For example, these tools work with RTL2832
based dongles (E4000, R820T, etc.) which have a noise figure of 20dB, only 8
bits in the A/D, and a crystal with a frequency error of about 100 ppm.

The 'CellSearch' program can be used to search for LTE carriers within a range
of frequencies.  Once an LTE frequency has been located, 'LTE-Tracker' can be
used to monitor and track, in realtime, any LTE cells on that frequency.

Basic Usage Instruction
------

If you don't know the center frequency of the LTE cells in your area, you will have to perform a search specifying the first and the last frequency of the band that you want the dongle to examine. See http://niviuk.free.fr/lte_band.php for a list of possible LTE bands.

In the US, the band between 715MHz and 768MHz often contains LTE carriers and the following command will search all possible LTE center frequencies there:

CellSearch --freq-start 715e6 --freq-end 768e6

On a dual core i7-2640 with the default PPM value of 120, this search takes about 6s per center frequency. With a PPM value of 10 (which requires a crystal calibration factor as described below), the search takes about 1s per center frequency.

If you know a frequency where LTE cells are located, perhaps from a previous call to CellSearch, you can specify just that frequency and the program will search for and report all cells detected on that frequency. In my location, in St. Louis, there are two LTE carriers, one for AT&T and one for Verizon. To scan for cells on those two frequencies:

CellSearch --freq-start 739000000

OR

CellSearch --freq-start 751000000

These same frequencies are known to have LTE carriers in San Francisco, Chicago, and Portland.
